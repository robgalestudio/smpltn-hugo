This is something I struggle with. I’ve been working on what has amounted to a three page comic for over 3 months now. It’s not because it’s so challenging to work on, or because I don’t have the skills to do a decent job. I’ve spent years honing my craft of drawing and countless hours working on my storytelling craft. Not to say that I’m the greatest by any means, but I definitely have put in the time and the work to develop my craft, and I think I’m at least passable when it comes to those two aspects. No it’s not because I don’t “know” how to do it. And it’s not for lack of time either. I don’t have any kids, and I have carved out a good 90 minutes every morning that I can simply devote to working on my personal projects. So it’s not a matter of time either, at least not for me. And I don’t think that time, in truth, is really the core problem for any of us. It’s always possible to carve out a few minutes to work on something we want to work on. If you watch television at all, you’ve got time to work on a personal project. No. I don’t think it has anything to do with the physical reasons that we often give as to why we can’t do something. 

So what is it? Why has this project taken me so long.
