In all of my creative endeavors I have found that it can be helpful to separate performance vs. practice. What I mean by this is that, the performance is like when you’re actually making a piece, writing a story, going for it with an actual illustrated project.

Client projects are performance, anything you put out into the world is performance. It’s essentially anything that you put your intention into and that you create for the sake of communicating your message.

Performance is where you take all the skills and talents and processes you have and you allow yourself to get into the flow and create. It’s the act of trusting in what you know and what you are and making. It relies on intuition and a feel for what you’re working on. The best way to perform is to get yourself into the flow of things, allowing the natural energies to dance on the skills and talents that are solidly in place to manifest as a final product. In order to perform well, you have to have put in the hours of practice to develop the skills to express what you want to express in a way that is elegant, effective, and powerful.

Practice is hard work. It feels scratchy and sticky and slow at times. There are a lot of stops and starts, corrections and changes of direction. You’re trying to find an effective way of doing things, of saying what you want to say. When you’re practicing, you often don’t make things that you’re all that proud of. You don’t get into a flow because you’re constantly correcting yourself or being corrected. That’s how you learn after all.

If I am asked to do a client project, and that project involves doing a lot of new things that I’m not familiar with, I need to build in time to practice so that I can get those skills into a state of fluidity, otherwise the end result ends up being less than stellar. My work can only be as good as my process and the skills I posess to make it.

Any time I need to do something new, something I’ve never done before, I’ve got to make sure I take the step to do studies and practice the techniques and get my process for doing that new thing really in place so that I don’t have to think about it when I’m creating. If I have to keep stopping myself to learn something new, I can never enter that state where I’m seeing the work as my audience will see it.

It has been helpful for me to recognize these two modes and to be mindful of when one is required vs. the other. Too often, as creatives, we fall in love with the performance aspect. We love entering the flow and indeed, that might be why we wanted to create in the first place. The problem is that when we get stuck there we might tend to repeat ourselves. If we’re creating for our own satisfaction and joy, then I have no problem with this. This is creativity as a hobby or a personal enrichment exercise. But if we want to communicate, if we want to create things for others to enjoy, we have to learn how to communicate effectively, and we have to push ourselves to grow. Not because we are supposed to fit someone else’s mould, but because we want to be effective artists.

On the flip side, if we only ever practice skills, we can become mere technicians, which again has its own satisfaction. But in order to find what it is we have to say, I think it’s important to perform, to see what stuff we’re made of. Our growth, and any creative project really relies on both.

Of course as with everything, it’s not an either or sort of situation. All projects have elements of both. Times when we’re frustrated and searching and trying something we’ve never tried before, and times when we are in a state of flow and enjoying the process almost as if we were reading the book, or looking at the picture as a member of our own audience.
