It’s easy to get lost in our work and see it as only we, its creator can see it. It’s easy to forget what we don’t know, to create work that is a kind of internal dialogue with ourselves. Especially when we aren’t able to step away and gain a proper perspective on what we’ve done.

Time is a gift that allows us perspective. It allows us to see what we didn’t see when we were in the energetic flow of the creative act. Taking time away from our work lets us put our mind onto other things. Lets us integrate the rest of the world.

Maybe it’s like this. When we’re creating something, writing a story, painting a picture, our minds get narrowed, focused onto it. This is good. We need to engage with our work intensely in order to find what it is we want to say. We search and enter into this alternate mental state of creating. We enter into a highly contextual place. This is both good and bad. Our minds become related only to the world of our story. We might be filling in blanks that we haven’t filled in on the page or in the image. We might deceive ourselves, not on purpose, but because of our familiarity with what we’re doing.  Our judgment becomes clouded by all of our neurons firing in relation to that altered state of engagement.

But when we step away, we allow the rest of the world in. We allow our minds to think about other things. We allow ourselves to gain perspective. And when we return to our work, we see it with our minds in that ordinary state. We can’t help but see it differently.

Only time allows us to change our mind. To expand it so that it’s more broadly focused on the life around us. It’s only through this bigger perspective that we can really hope to see our work as others might.
