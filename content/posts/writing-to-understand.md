When there is nothing else, write to understand the world. To understand what is going on inside and to try and get a handle on what is going on outside.

They say that writing clearly is learning to think clearly.

We can’t communicate our ideas unless we first understand them, and the opposite is also true. We don’t really know what we know until we can articulate our thoughts effectively.

But what does this look like? This search for understanding?

Some of it is being able to quiet ourselves and look inward. To be able to honestly assess and witness the subtle movements within. To acknowledge our fears and our ignorance.

Some of it is being mindful enough to articulate what it is we don’t know. It is taking the time to look and read and clarify the questions. If we aren’t able to articulate what we don’t know, we don’t know where to look.

Some of it is learning to focus. Allowing ourselves to sit with our questions long enough to find real answers. Giving these answers time to connect and grow into discreet and meaningful ideas.

Finally, it’s learning to put those ideas into words that resonate. If we can take ourselves on a journey from ignorance to knowledge, and then put that on paper, chances are good that someone else will be able to join us on the way.
