<p>This is something I struggle with. I’ve been working on what has amounted to a three page comic for over 3 months now. It’s not because it’s so challenging to work on, or because I don’t have the skills to do a decent job. I’ve spent years honing my craft of drawing and countless hours working on my storytelling craft. Not to say that I’m the greatest by any means, but I definitely have put in the time and the work to develop my craft, and I think I’m at least passable when it comes to those two aspects. No it’s not because I don’t “know” how to do it. And it’s not for lack of time either. I don’t have any kids, and I have carved out a good 90 minutes every morning that I can simply devote to working on my personal projects. So it’s not a matter of time either, at least not for me. And I don’t think that time, in truth, is really the core problem for any of us. It’s always possible to carve out a few minutes to work on something we want to work on. If you watch television at all, you’ve got time to work on a personal project. No. I don’t think it has anything to do with the physical reasons that we often give as to why we can’t do something.</p>
<p>So what is it? Why has this project taken me so long.</p>
