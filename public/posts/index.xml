          Or the messiness of new creative projects. Brains. And choosy people. This is cool. It actually updates in real time.
So yeah. this is pretty nice because it’s so freaking simple! I love it I love it I love it.

          This is something I struggle with. I’ve been working on what has amounted to a three page comic for over 3 months now. It’s not because it’s so challenging to work on, or because I don’t have the skills to do a decent job. I’ve spent years honing my craft of drawing and countless hours working on my storytelling craft. Not to say that I’m the greatest by any means, but I definitely have put in the time and the work to develop my craft, and I think I’m at least passable when it comes to those two aspects.
